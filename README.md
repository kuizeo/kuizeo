# Hi, I'm kuizeo.

I make things sometimes, most often in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++,
Rust, and V. Currently, I'm uploading some of my old projects to GitHub (and
updating a few).

If you've found a bug in a project of mine, I tend to check issues often, so
hopefully it will be fixed quickly.
